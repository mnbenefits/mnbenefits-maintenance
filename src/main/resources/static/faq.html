Because of the pandemic, counties and Tribal Nations are receiving a higher volume of applications than normal. It may take longer than usual to hear back. If it’s been more than two weeks and you haven’t gotten any mail or phone calls from your county or Tribal Nation, or you want to contact them directly, you can <a href="https://edocs.dhs.state.mn.us/lfserver/Public/DHS-5207-ENG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">find their phone number here</a>.</p>
